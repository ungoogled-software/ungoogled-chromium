Subject: [PATCH] media/gpu/vaapi: Fix the VA_CHECK_VERSION

commit 6f1309ef8fe109 ("media/gpu/vaapi: Relax the version
check for VA-API") added the VA_CHECK_VERSION to relax the
VA-API version check. But it still does the same thing as
the previous check. VA_CHECK_VERSION will return 'true', only
when the VA-API version is greater than or equal to the
parameters passed to it. So in this case when the major and
minor version were passed from vaInitialize() output, it did
the same strict check as earlier. When trying to update libva
to a newer version, there will still be a mismatch, since
vaInitialize() would return the updated/newer libva version
installed on the system, but the chromium would still be built
with older version (libva-2.1.0 as of now).
To fix this and actually relax the check, make sure the system
version of libva is greater than the libva version with which
the browser is built, since libva is backward compatible. This
will allow any future libva updates without breaking existing code.

Fixes: 6f1309ef8fe109 ("media/gpu/vaapi: Relax the version check for VA-API")

Bug: 905814
TEST=Below scenarios were tested and h/w acceleration is working successfully.
TEST=Build chromium with libva-2.3.0 and system version 2.3.0
TEST=Build chromium with libva-2.1.0 and system version 2.3.0
TEST=Build chromium with libva 2.1.0 and system version 2.1.0
